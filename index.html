      <p>My ship is currently docked in Manchester, UK. 
        Over the last 10 years I have equipped my vessel with a multitude of gadgets and gizmos for the voyage that lay ahead. Digital design, 3D printing, and digital illustration are among my favourite tools aboard ship!
        As a self-proclaimed maker I enjoy all forms of creation. Working digitally or with my hands to create for enjoyment or to solve problems. I am a computer enthusiast; building and fixing PCs for myself and friends/family. 
        I enjoy documentaries and film. In particular, Sci-Fi and World Science, Technology and Social development.
        I have a passion for music and play a handful of instruments.
        Looking to the future I recognised the significance of interconnectivity, automation, machine learning, and real-time data on the future of mankind, and the world as we know it. 
        This brings me to my most recent mission - a coding Bootcamp!
